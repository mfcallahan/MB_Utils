MB_Utils
=======

MB_Utils is a MapBasic (11.0 +) module and .NET (4.0) library that extends MBX programming functionality by wrapping .NET and Win32 API calls in easy to use MapBasic functions and subs. See Documentation.txt and Sample.pdf for complete documentation and usage exmaples.  This project was the first library I ever wrote and was a great learning experience in how to document, release, and support an open source software project, albeit on a small scale. I'm sharing this here to show how my career and code quality has progressed.

*Active development on MB_Utils has ceased.*
